Sample high-level sentences

    Macbeth's initial reluctance to kill Duncan shows that he still has a sense of morality and is not completely corrupted by his ambition, which contrasts with Lady Macbeth's more ruthless and single-minded approach.
    However, Lady Macbeth's manipulation and emotional blackmailing of Macbeth ultimately leads him to commit the murder, which highlights the power dynamic in their relationship and the extent to which Lady Macbeth is willing to go to achieve her goals.
    Throughout the play, there are moments where Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's relationship appears strained or even hostile, such as when Lady Macbeth chastises Macbeth for seeing Banquo's ghost. This suggests that their relationship is not as stable as it may initially seem, and that there are underlying tensions and conflicts between them.
    The deterioration of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's relationship mirrors the deterioration of their mental states, as they become increasingly consumed by guilt, paranoia, and madness. This highlights the psychological toll of their actions and the consequences of their unchecked ambition.
    Shakespeare's use of language and imagery, such as Lady Macbeth's invocation of darkness and spirits, emphasizes the unnatural and unsettling nature of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's actions and the sinister quality of their relationship.

### Starting with Act 2 Scene 1, lines 33 to 61 and considering the entire play, to what extent does Shakespeare present Macbeth as an evil character?

I. Introduction:

    Introduce the play and the character of Macbeth.
    Provide the context of Act 2 Scene 1 and the lines 33 to 61.
    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth as an evil character to a great extent, using a range of techniques and symbols to convey his moral corruption and psychological deterioration.

II. Paragraph 1:

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through his actions and behavior.
    Introduce Act 2 Scene 1 and the context of the scene (Macbeth's soliloquy).
    Quote: "Is this a dagger which I see before me, / The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee." (2.1.33-34)
    Analysis: Macbeth's hallucination of the dagger is a symbol of his inner turmoil and moral confusion. The fact that he is willing to clutch a dagger that may or may not be real shows that he is willing to commit murder, and that he is already starting to lose touch with reality.
    Quote: "I go, and it is done: the bell invites me. / Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell / That summons thee to heaven or to hell." (2.1.61-63)
    Analysis: Macbeth's intention to kill Duncan shows his ambition and his willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means committing murder. The fact that he is aware of the gravity of his actions (the "knell" that summons Duncan to either heaven or hell) shows that he is not completely devoid of moral consciousness, but he is still willing to do it anyway.

III. Paragraph 2

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through the manipulation and influence of Lady Macbeth.
    Introduce Act 1 Scene 5 and the context of the scene (Lady Macbeth's soliloquy).
    Quote: "Come, you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, / And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full / Of direst cruelty!" (1.5.39-43)
    Analysis: Lady Macbeth's desire to be "unsexed" and filled with cruelty is a manifestation of her evil nature and her willingness to manipulate Macbeth to achieve their shared ambition. She is willing to call on supernatural forces to help her achieve her goals, and her willingness to "fill" herself with cruelty shows that she is not morally pure.
    Quote: "What beast was't then / That made you break this enterprise to me?" (1.7.47-48)
    Analysis: Lady Macbeth questions Macbeth's manhood and challenges him to commit murder, using manipulation and guilt to coerce him into doing her bidding. This shows her willingness to use any means necessary to achieve their shared ambition, and her lack of concern for the moral consequences of their actions.

IV. Paragraph 3:

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through the supernatural elements of the play.
    Introduce Act 4 Scene 1 and the context of the scene (the witches' prophecies).
    Quote: "By the pricking of my thumbs, / Something wicked this way comes." (4.1.44-45)
    Analysis: The witches' prophecy about Macbeth's arrival is a symbol of his evil nature and his association with the supernatural. The fact that the witches refer to him as "something wicked" shows that he is not a morally pure character, and his association with the supernatural further emphasizes his moral corruption.
    Quote: "Double, double toil and trouble; / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble." (4.1.10-11)
    Analysis: The witches' spell is a symbol of Macbeth's descent into madness and his willingness to embrace evil and supernatural forces. The fact that the spell is accompanied by strange and ominous imagery (toil, trouble, fire, and bubbling cauldrons) shows that Macbeth is not completely removed from the supernatural elements of the play, and that his association with the witches is a sign of his moral corruption. The spell also foreshadows the violence and chaos that will ensue as a result of Macbeth's actions.

Conclusion:

    Summarize the main points of the essay: Shakespeare presents Macbeth as an evil character to a great extent, using a range of techniques and symbols to convey his moral corruption and psychological deterioration.
    Restate the thesis statement and main arguments.
    Link the play to the context of the time, emphasizing the idea of power and the monarch.
    Concluding statement: In Macbeth, Shakespeare creates a character who is consumed by his own ambition and moral decay, and presents a powerful commentary on the nature of evil and the consequences of unchecked power.

This suggests that their relationship is not as stable as it may initially seem, and that there are underlying tensions and conflicts between them.
    The deterioration of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's relationship mirrors the deterioration of their mental states, as they become increasingly consumed by guilt, paranoia, and madness. This highlights the psychological toll of their actions and the consequences of their unchecked ambition.
    Shakespeare's use of language and imagery, such as Lady Macbeth's invocation of darkness and spirits, emphasizes the unnatural and unsettling nature of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's actions and the sinister quality of their relationship.

### Starting with Act 2 Scene 1, lines 33 to 61 and considering the entire play, to what extent does Shakespeare present Macbeth as an evil character?

I. Introduction:

    Introduce the play and the character of Macbeth.
    Provide the context of Act 2 Scene 1 and the lines 33 to 61.
    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth as an evil character to a great extent, using a range of techniques and symbols to convey his moral corruption and psychological deterioration.

II. Paragraph 1:

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through his actions and behavior.
    Introduce Act 2 Scene 1 and the context of the scene (Macbeth's soliloquy).
    Quote: "Is this a dagger which I see before me, / The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee." (2.1.33-34)
    Analysis: Macbeth's hallucination of the dagger is a symbol of his inner turmoil and moral confusion. The fact that he is willing to clutch a dagger that may or may not be real shows that he is willing to commit murder, and that he is already starting to lose touch with reality.
    Quote: "I go, and it is done: the bell invites me. / Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell / That summons thee to heaven or to hell." (2.1.61-63)
    Analysis: Macbeth's intention to kill Duncan shows his ambition and his willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means committing murder. The fact that he is aware of the gravity of his actions (the "knell" that summons Duncan to either heaven or hell) shows that he is not completely devoid of moral consciousness, but he is still willing to do it anyway.

III. Paragraph 2

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through the manipulation and influence of Lady Macbeth.
    Introduce Act 1 Scene 5 and the context of the scene (Lady Macbeth's soliloquy).
    Quote: "Come, you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, / And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full / Of direst cruelty!" (1.5.39-43)
    Analysis: Lady Macbeth's desire to be "unsexed" and filled with cruelty is a manifestation of her evil nature and her willingness to manipulate Macbeth to achieve their shared ambition. She is willing to call on supernatural forces to help her achieve her goals, and her willingness to "fill" herself with cruelty shows that she is not morally pure.
    Quote: "What beast was't then / That made you break this enterprise to me?" (1.7.47-48)
    Analysis: Lady Macbeth questions Macbeth's manhood and challenges him to commit murder, using manipulation and guilt to coerce him into doing her bidding. This shows her willingness to use any means necessary to achieve their shared ambition, and her lack of concern for the moral consequences of their actions.

IV. Paragraph 3:

    Thesis statement: Shakespeare presents Macbeth's evil nature through the supernatural elements of the play.
    Introduce Act 4 Scene 1 and the context of the scene (the witches' prophecies).
    Quote: "By the pricking of my thumbs, / Something wicked this way comes." (4.1.44-45)
    Analysis: The witches' prophecy about Macbeth's arrival is a symbol of his evil nature and his association with the supernatural. The fact that the witches refer to him as "something wicked" shows that he is not a morally pure character, and his association with the supernatural further emphasizes his moral corruption.
    Quote: "Double, double toil and trouble; / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble." (4.1.10-11)
    Analysis: The witches' spell is a symbol of Macbeth's descent into madness and his willingness to embrace evil and supernatural forces. The fact that the spell is accompanied by strange and ominous imagery (toil, trouble, fire, and bubbling cauldrons) shows that Macbeth is not completely removed from the supernatural elements of the play, and that his association with the witches is a sign of his moral corruption. The spell also foreshadows the violence and chaos that will ensue as a result of Macbeth's actions.

Conclusion:

    Summarize the main points of the essay: Shakespeare presents Macbeth as an evil character to a great extent, using a range of techniques and symbols to convey his moral corruption and psychological deterioration.
    Restate the thesis statement and main arguments.
    Link the play to the context of the time, emphasizing the idea of power and the monarch.
    Concluding statement: In Macbeth, Shakespeare creates a character who is consumed by his own ambition and moral decay, and presents a powerful commentary on the nature of evil and the consequences of unchecked power.

    Provide background information about Macbeth's actions leading up to this scene and his overall character
    State the thesis that Shakespeare presents Macbeth as remorseful for his actions to a certain extent throughout the play, but also shows how his guilt is ultimately overshadowed by his ambition and desire for power

II. Body Paragraph 1

    In Act 3 Scene 4, Macbeth's conscience is clearly troubled by his actions as he encounters the ghost of Banquo during the feast. When he sees the ghost, he exclaims "Avaunt and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!" (3.4.92-93), showing his fear and guilt. This encounter with Banquo's ghost is not only a reminder of his heinous crime but also demonstrates Macbeth's mental state as his ambition has taken control of him. He is seeing things that are not there, which emphasizes the corrupting influence of his ambition on his mind. The scene also demonstrates that Macbeth's sense of guilt has become unbearable, leading him to crack under the weight of his conscience. The ghost symbolizes the guilt that Macbeth carries with him and it is a clear indication that his ambition has corrupted him beyond redemption.

    Provide additional evidence from other parts of the play where Macbeth's ambition takes priority over his conscience, such as his decision to kill Banquo and attempt to kill Fleance in Act 3 Scene 3
    Use contextual links, such as the idea of kingship and the divine right of monarchs, to show how Macbeth's ambition reflects larger societal concerns of Shakespeare's time

IV. Body Paragraph 3

    Return to the question of Macbeth's remorse and guilt and consider how these emotions evolve over the course of the play
    Use quotes and analysis to show how Macbeth's sense of remorse and guilt becomes more muted as his ambition takes over, such as when he says, "I 'gin to be aweary of the sun" in Act 5 Scene 5
    Provide additional evidence from other parts of the play where Macbeth's guilt seems to diminish, such as his lack of concern over Lady Macbeth's death in Act 5 Scene 5
    Use high-level vocabulary and specific examples to convey the tragic nature of Macbeth's downfall and the ways in which his remorse and guilt are ultimately inadequate to save him from his fate

V. Conclusion

    Summarize the main points of the essay, including the thesis that Shakespeare presents Macbeth as remorseful for his actions to a certain extent throughout the play, but also shows how his guilt is ultimately overshadowed by his ambition and desire for power

### Starting with Act 4 Scene 1, when Macbeth visits the witches again for further information (lines 49-61) and considering the entire play, to what extent does Shakespeare present Macbeth as in control of his own fate?
I. Introduction

    Briefly introduce the play and its context (i.e. when and where it was written, the main themes and characters)
    Present the question and provide a brief overview of how you will answer it
    Thesis statement: Although Macbeth believes that he is in control of his own fate, Shakespeare presents him as being ultimately controlled by his ambition and the supernatural forces at play in the play.

II. Macbeth's encounter with the witches in Act 4 Scene 1

    Provide a brief summary of the extract and its context within the play
    Thesis statement: In this extract, Macbeth appears to be in control of his own fate as he seeks out the witches for further information. However, the witches' prophesies and their supernatural powers ultimately undermine Macbeth's sense of control.
    Evidence: "How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is't you do?" (line 49). "I conjure you, by that which you profess, howe'er you come to know it, answer me" (lines 50-51). "Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?" (lines 81-82).
    Analysis: Macbeth's language and tone in this scene suggest that he is confident and in control. He demands answers from the witches and appears to be unafraid of any potential consequences. However, the witches' prophesies, particularly the one about Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, suggest that Macbeth's fate is already predetermined, and his actions will ultimately lead to his downfall.

III. Macbeth's sense of control throughout the play

    Thesis statement: Throughout the play, Macbeth's belief in his own agency and control over his fate is repeatedly undermined by his ambition, guilt, and the supernatural forces at work in the play.
    Evidence: "I have no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition" (Act 1 Scene 7, lines 25-27). "I am in blood / Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o'er" (Act 3 Scene 4, lines 136-138). "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!" (Act 5 Scene 1, line 25).
    Analysis: Macbeth's ambition drives him to commit increasingly heinous acts throughout the play, ultimately leading to his downfall. Despite his initial reluctance to kill Duncan, he is eventually swayed by his wife's ambition and the prophesies of the witches. His guilt and hallucinations later in the play suggest that he is not in control of his own fate, as his conscience is plagued by the consequences of his actions.

IV. Other characters' influences

    Analyze how Shakespeare uses other characters to emphasize the idea that Macbeth is not in control of his own fate, such as the prophecies of the witches and the manipulations of Lady Macbeth
    Use quotes to illustrate the characters' beliefs about fate and free will, such as "All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor! / All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!" (Act 1, Scene 3, lines 48-49)
    Analyze how Shakespeare uses these beliefs to develop the theme of fate versus free will throughout the play
    Discuss the significance of the play's conclusion in terms of the idea of fate versus free will

V. Conclusion

    Summarize the main points made in the essay
    Restate the thesis and provide a final analysis of how Shakespeare presents Macbeth's sense of control over his own fate in the play
    Consider the broader implications of the play's themes and the contextual links that can be made to the time period in which it was written.
